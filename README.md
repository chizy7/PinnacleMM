PinnacleMM is a high-performance, production-grade market making system designed for high-frequency trading in cryptocurrency markets. Built primarily in C++ with a focus on ultra-low latency, this system achieves microsecond-level execution speeds while maintaining robust risk management capabilities.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Ultra-Low Latency Core**: Optimized C++ engine with lock-free data structures
- **Nanosecond Precision**: High-resolution timing for accurate execution
- **Dynamic Market Making**: Adaptive bid-ask spread based on market conditions
- **Position Management**: Intelligent inventory management with customizable risk parameters
- **Exchange Simulation**: Realistic market simulation for strategy development and testing
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test suite ensuring reliability and performance

## 📊 System Architecture

PinnacleMM follows a modular, layered architecture:

- **Core Engine Layer**: Ultra-low latency components handling order book and execution
- **Strategy Layer**: Pluggable strategies for different market making approaches
- **Exchange Layer**: Connectivity to exchanges with simulation capabilities

## 📋 Development Roadmap

PinnacleMM is being developed in phases:

- ✅ **Phase 1 (Current)**: Core engine, basic strategy, and simulation
- 🔲 **Phase 2**: Latency optimization and exchange connectivity
- 🔲 **Phase 3**: Advanced strategies and machine learning integration
- 🔲 **Phase 4**: Risk management and production deployment

See the detailed [project roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for more information.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, or MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.14+
- Boost libraries 1.72+
- spdlog library (for structured logging)
- fmt library (for formatting, spdlog dependency)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chizy7/PinnacleMM.git
cd PinnacleMM

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake (disable tests and benchmarks for now)
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF

# Build the project
# For macOS:
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
# For Linux:
# make -j$(nproc)
```

### Running PinnacleMM

```bash
# Run in simulation mode
./pinnaclemm --mode simulation --symbol BTC-USD
```

Example output:
```
