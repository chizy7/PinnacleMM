# PinnacleMM Project Roadmap

## Overview

PinnacleMM is an ultra-low latency market making system designed for high-frequency trading in cryptocurrency markets. This roadmap outlines the development plan across multiple phases, with clear milestones and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

**Goal:** Establish the core architecture and basic functionality of the system.

### Deliverables
- Core order book engine with nanosecond precision
- Basic market making strategy implementation
- Exchange simulator for testing
- Thread-safe, high-performance data structures
- Comprehensive unit tests for core components
- Build system with CMake
- Docker containerization

### Key Features Implemented
- Ultra-low latency order book with lock-free structures
- Dynamic spread adjustment based on order book imbalance
- Position and P&L tracking
- Realistic market simulation with configurable parameters
- High-precision timing utilities

## Phase 2: Latency Optimization & Exchange Connectivity (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Optimize for production-level performance and add real exchange connectivity.

### Deliverables
- Lock-free data structures for all critical paths
- ℹ️ Kernel bypass networking using DPDK (**TODO**: Deferred - requires specialized hardware)
- Memory-mapped file system for data persistence
- Secure API credentials management with encryption
- WebSocket integration for real-time market data
- **Real exchange connectors**
    - ✅ **Coinbase Pro connector (PRODUCTION-READY)** - Live WebSocket with real-time market data
    - 🔄 Kraken connector (framework ready)
    - 🔄 Gemini connector (framework ready)
    - 🔄 Binance connector (framework ready)
    - 🔄 Bitstamp connector (framework ready)
- ✅ FIX protocol support for select exchanges
- ✅ **Advanced order routing logic**
- ✅ **Detailed performance benchmarking suite**

### Status Notes
- **DPDK Implementation**: Implementation of kernel bypass networking using DPDK has been deferred. DPDK requires specialized hardware support that is not available in typical development environments, especially macOS. It also involves system-level modifications that are best implemented in a dedicated Linux environment. This component will be revisited when suitable hardware and environment are available.

### PHASE 2 UPDATE - COMPLETED
