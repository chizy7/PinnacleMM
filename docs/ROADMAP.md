# PinnacleMM Project Roadmap

## Overview

PinnacleMM is an ultra-low latency market making system designed for high-frequency trading in cryptocurrency markets. This roadmap outlines the development plan across multiple phases, with clear milestones and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Foundation 

**Goal:** Establish the core architecture and basic functionality of the system.

### Deliverables
- ✅ Core order book engine with nanosecond precision
- ✅ Basic market making strategy implementation
- ✅ Exchange simulator for testing
- ✅ Thread-safe, high-performance data structures
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for core components
- ✅ Build system with CMake
- ✅ Docker containerization

### Key Features Implemented
- Ultra-low latency order book with lock-free structures
- Dynamic spread adjustment based on order book imbalance
- Position and P&L tracking
- Realistic market simulation with configurable parameters
- High-precision timing utilities

## Phase 2: Latency Optimization & Exchange Connectivity (Current Phase) ✅

**Goal:** Optimize for production-level performance and add real exchange connectivity.

### Deliverables
- ✅ Lock-free data structures for all critical paths
- ℹ️ Kernel bypass networking using DPDK (**TODO**: Deferred - requires specialized hardware)
- ✅ Memory-mapped file system for data persistence
- 🔲 Real exchange connectors (Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini)
- 🔲 WebSocket integration for real-time market data
- 🔲 FIX protocol support for select exchanges
- 🔲 Advanced order routing logic
- 🔲 Detailed performance benchmarking suite

### Status Notes
- **DPDK Implementation**: Implementation of kernel bypass networking using DPDK has been deferred. DPDK requires specialized hardware support that is not available in typical development environments, especially macOS. It also involves system-level modifications that are best implemented in a dedicated Linux environment. This component will be revisited when suitable hardware and environment are available. 

### Expected Completion
- 4 weeks

## Phase 3: Advanced Trading Strategies & ML Integration

**Goal:** Enhance market making with sophisticated algorithms and machine learning.

### Deliverables
- 🔲 ML-based spread optimization model
- 🔲 Order book flow analysis
- 🔲 Predictive market impact models
- 🔲 Adaptive parameters using reinforcement learning
- 🔲 Market regime detection
- 🔲 Advanced backtesting with historical data
- 🔲 Strategy performance visualization

### Expected Completion
- 4 weeks

## Phase 4: Risk Management & Production Readiness

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive risk controls and prepare for production deployment.

### Deliverables
- 🔲 Position and exposure limits with auto-hedging
- 🔲 VaR calculation with Monte Carlo simulations
- 🔲 Circuit breakers for extreme market conditions
- 🔲 Real-time monitoring dashboard
- 🔲 Alerting system for unusual conditions
- 🔲 Logging and audit trail
- 🔲 Kubernetes deployment configuration
- 🔲 Disaster recovery procedures

### Expected Completion
- 4 weeks

## Phase 5: Optimization & Scaling

**Goal:** Fine-tune performance and scale to multiple markets.

### Deliverables
- 🔲 Multi-instrument support
- 🔲 Cross-exchange arbitrage capabilities
- 🔲 Advanced statistical models for cross-market correlations
- 🔲 Dynamic resource allocation
- 🔲 Performance profiling and additional optimizations
- 🔲 Comprehensive documentation and case studies

### Expected Completion
- 4 weeks

## Current Status

Phase 1 is now completed, establishing the foundation of my ultra-low latency market making system. The core order book engine, basic market making strategy, and testing infrastructure are in place. I am now ready to proceed to Phase 2, which will focus on further latency optimizations and adding real exchange connectivity.
