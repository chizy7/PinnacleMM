# PinnacleMM System Architecture

## Overview

PinnacleMM is designed with a modular, layered architecture to achieve ultra-low latency performance while maintaining flexibility and extensibility. The system is built around a high-performance core that handles critical functions with minimal overhead, surrounded by layers of increasingly higher-level functionality.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Performance-First Design**: Critical paths are optimized for minimum latency
2. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between components
3. **Testability**: Components are designed to be testable in isolation
4. **Thread Safety**: Concurrent operations are supported with minimal locking
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: External dependencies are carefully managed

## System Layers

The architecture is divided into three main layers, each with specific responsibilities:

### 1. Core Engine Layer

The foundation of PinnacleMM, responsible for the most performance-critical operations.

**Components:**
- **Order Book**: Maintains the full limit order book with nanosecond precision
- **Time Utilities**: High-precision timing functions and measurements
- **Lock-Free Queues**: Thread-safe communication without locks
- **Order Management**: Order creation, modification, and cancellation

**Key Characteristics:**
- Written in optimized C++ with cache-friendly data structures
- Uses lock-free algorithms where possible
- Minimal external dependencies
- Designed for microsecond-level latency

### 2. Strategy Layer

Implements market making strategies and decision logic.

**Components:**
- **BasicMarketMaker**: Implements the core market making algorithm
- **StrategyConfig**: Configuration parameters for strategies
- **Position Management**: Tracking and managing trading positions
- **P&L Calculation**: Real-time profit and loss monitoring

**Key Characteristics:**
- Event-driven architecture
- Configurable parameters for different market conditions
- Thread-safe interaction with the core layer

### 3. Exchange Layer

Handles interaction with exchanges and market data.

**Components:**
- **Exchange Simulator**: Simulates an exchange for testing and development
- **WebSocket Market Data Feed**: Real-time market data via WebSocket connections
- **Exchange Connectors**: Live connectivity to cryptocurrency exchanges (Coinbase Pro production-ready)
- **Market Data Feed**: Processes and distributes market data
- **Order Execution**: Handles order submission and confirmation
- **Secure Config**: Encrypted API credential management

**Key Characteristics:**
- Abstracts exchange-specific differences
- Handles network I/O efficiently with Boost.Beast WebSocket + SSL/TLS
- Manages live market data flow from real exchanges
- Secure credential storage with AES-256-CBC encryption

### 4. Persistence Layer (Added in Phase 2)

The persistence layer provides data durability and crash recovery capabilities.

**Components:**
- **Journal**: Records all order book operations in a transaction log
- **Snapshot Manager**: Creates periodic snapshots of the system state
- **Recovery Manager**: Restores system state after crashes or restarts

**Key Characteristics:**
- Uses memory-mapped files for ultra-low latency I/O operations
- Minimizes performance impact on critical trading paths
- Enables instant restart without lengthy replay operations
- Maintains historical order and execution data

## Data Flow

1. **Live Market Data Flow**:
   - Real-time market data arrives from Coinbase Pro WebSocket feed
   - WebSocketMarketDataFeed processes JSON ticker messages
   - Price and volume data is normalized and distributed
   - Order Book receives live market updates
   - Strategy components are notified of real-time market changes

2. **Strategy Decision Flow**:
   - Market Maker evaluates live market conditions
   - Decisions are made based on real-time price spreads and volume
   - Commands are sent to the Order Book
   - Orders are executed or prepared for exchange submission

3. **Credential Security Flow**:
   - Master password prompts user authentication
   - PBKDF2 derives encryption key from password + salt
   - AES-256-CBC decrypts stored API credentials
   - Credentials are provided to exchange connectors securely
   - Memory is cleared after use to prevent exposure

4. **Order Execution Flow**:
   - Orders are validated by the Core Engine
   - Valid orders are added to the Order Book
   - Orders may match against existing orders or be sent to exchange
   - Execution results are reported back to the Strategy Layer

## Thread Model

PinnacleMM uses a multithreaded design for optimal performance:

1. **Market Data Thread**: Processes incoming market data
2. **Strategy Thread**: Runs the market making algorithm
3. **Execution Thread**: Handles order execution
4. **Monitoring Thread**: Tracks system performance

Threads communicate using lock-free queues to minimize contention.

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Custom memory allocation for critical components
- **Cache Optimization**: Data structures designed to minimize cache misses
- **Lock-Free Algorithms**: Used extensively to avoid mutex contention
- **Batched Processing**: Operations are batched where possible to reduce overhead

## Current Implementation Status

### Phase 1 (Completed) 

- Complete Order Book implementation with price level management
- Basic Market Making strategy with dynamic spread adjustment
- Exchange Simulator for testing
- Thread-safe data structures and utilities
- Comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 2 (Completed) 

- Lock-free data structures for all critical paths
- Memory-mapped file system for data persistence
- Secure API credentials management with AES-256-CBC encryption + PBKDF2
- WebSocket integration for real-time market data using Boost.Beast
- **Live Exchange Connectivity**: Production-ready Coinbase Pro connector
  - Real-time ticker data processing (BTC-USD ~$109,200+)
  - Secure WebSocket connection with SSL/TLS
  - Interactive credential setup utility
  - Multiple market updates per second with automatic reconnection

**System Status**: Production-ready for live cryptocurrency market making operations

### Next: Phase 3 - Advanced Trading Strategies & ML Integration

Future phases will build on this live connectivity foundation to add advanced strategies, machine learning integration, and multi-exchange support.
