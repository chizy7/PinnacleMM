# Crash Recovery Guide

This guide explains how the PinnacleMM crash recovery system works and how to configure and troubleshoot it.

## How Recovery Works

PinnacleMM uses a combination of journaling and snapshots to provide crash recovery:

1. **Journaling**: Every order operation (add, cancel, execute) is recorded in a journal file
2. **Snapshots**: Periodic snapshots of the order book state are taken
3. **Recovery**: On startup, the system loads the latest snapshot and replays recent journal entries

This ensures that after a crash or unexpected shutdown, the system can recover to its previous state with minimal data loss.

## Directory Structure

The persistence system creates and uses the following directory structure:

```
data/
├── journals/
│   └── [SYMBOL].journal      # One journal file per trading instrument
└── snapshots/
    └── [SYMBOL]/
        └── [SYMBOL]-[TIMESTAMP].snapshot    # Snapshot files
```

## Configuration Options

The persistence system can be configured in the `default_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "persistence": {
    "enabled": true,
    "dataDirectory": "data",
    "journalSyncIntervalMs": 100,
    "snapshotIntervalMin": 15,
    "keepSnapshots": 5,
    "compactionThreshold": 1000000
  }
}
```

### Parameters

- `enabled`: Enables or disables the persistence system
- `dataDirectory`: Base directory for journals and snapshots
- `journalSyncIntervalMs`: How often to force journal synchronization (milliseconds)
- `snapshotIntervalMin`: How often to create snapshots (minutes)
- `keepSnapshots`: Number of snapshots to retain before deletion
- `compactionThreshold`: Journal size threshold for compaction (bytes)

## Monitoring Recovery

When the system starts up, it will output log messages indicating the recovery process:

```
[INFO] Initializing persistence for BTC-USD
[INFO] Loading latest snapshot from 1712345678900
[INFO] Replaying 42 journal entries
[INFO] Recovery completed successfully
```

You can check if recovery is working correctly by:

1. Running the system for a while to generate orders and trades
2. Force-quitting the application (e.g., with `kill -9`)
3. Restarting and verifying that the order book state is preserved

## Troubleshooting

### Journal Files Not Created

**Symptoms**: No journal files appear in the data directory.

**Solutions**:
- Check file system permissions
- Ensure the data directory is writable
- Verify that persistence is enabled in the configuration

### Recovery Fails

**Symptoms**: System reports errors during recovery or starts with an empty order book.

**Solutions**:
- Check for journal file corruption
- Verify that snapshots exist and are readable
- Check log files for specific error messages
- Ensure there is sufficient disk space

### Performance Issues

**Symptoms**: System becomes slow when journaling or creating snapshots.

**Solutions**:
- Increase the snapshot interval
- Move the data directory to a faster storage device
- Reduce journal sync frequency
- Consider using an SSD for improved performance

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

The macOS implementation uses a different memory-mapping approach than Linux due to platform limitations:

- Uses a combination of `munmap`/`mmap` instead of `mremap` for file resizing
- May have slightly higher overhead during journal resizing operations

### Linux

On Linux systems, additional performance can be gained by:

- Using XFS or Ext4 file systems with appropriate mount options
- Configuring higher limits for memory-mapped regions
- Using direct I/O for snapshots if available

## Data Backup

Although the persistence system provides crash recovery, it is not a replacement for proper backups:

1. Regularly back up the entire data directory
2. Consider incremental backups of journal files
3. Test recovery from backups periodically

## Note on DPDK Integration

The original plan included DPDK integration for kernel bypass networking, which has been deferred because:

1. It requires specialized hardware support not available in typical development environments
2. It has limited support for macOS, which is used as a development platform
3. It involves system-level modifications best implemented in a dedicated environment

DPDK integration will be revisited when suitable hardware and environment are available.
