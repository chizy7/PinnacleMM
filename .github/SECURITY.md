# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

I take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in PinnacleMM, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please send an email to: **chizy@chizyhub.com** (or create a private issue)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: I will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24-48 hours
- **Assessment**: I will assess the vulnerability and provide an initial response within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: I will work to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Credit**: I will credit you in my security acknowledgments (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 2.x.x   | ✅ Fully supported |
| 1.x.x   | ⚠️ Security fixes only |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No longer supported |

## Security Features

PinnacleMM includes several security features:

### Credential Protection
- **AES-256-CBC encryption** for API credentials
- **PBKDF2 key derivation** with 100,000 iterations
- **Unique salt generation** per configuration file
- **Secure memory clearing** to prevent credential leakage
- **Cross-platform secure input** with terminal masking

### Network Security
- **SSL/TLS encryption** for all WebSocket connections
- **Certificate pinning** to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Input validation** framework preventing injection attacks
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse and DoS attacks

### Audit and Monitoring
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for security events
- **Failed authentication tracking**
- **Real-time security alerts**
- **Structured logging** for compliance and monitoring

### Development Security
- **Static analysis** via CodeQL in CI/CD
- **Dependency scanning** via Dependabot
- **Security-focused code reviews**
- **Automated security testing**

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Strong Master Passwords**: Use complex, unique passwords
2. **API Key Permissions**: Limit API keys to minimum required permissions
3. **IP Restrictions**: Configure IP restrictions on exchange API keys
4. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate API credentials periodically
5. **Secure Environment**: Run PinnacleMM on secure, updated systems
6. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check audit logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers
1. **Never commit credentials** to version control
2. **Validate all input** before processing
3. **Use secure coding practices** (OWASP guidelines)
4. **Clear sensitive data** from memory after use
5. **Follow principle of least privilege**
6. **Document security implications** of changes

## Threat Model

### Assets Protected
- Exchange API credentials
- Trading strategies and algorithms
- Market data and trading history
- System configuration and settings

### Potential Threats
- **Credential theft** through malware or system compromise
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks** on network communications
- **Injection attacks** through malicious input
- **Denial of service** attacks on API endpoints
- **Insider threats** from malicious code contributions

### Mitigations

- Comprehensive input validation
- Network security controls
- Code review and static analysis
- Audit logging and monitoring

## Compliance

PinnacleMM is designed with the following compliance considerations:
- **Financial data protection** standards
- **Audit trail requirements** for trading systems
- **Data privacy** regulations
- **Security logging** for regulatory compliance

## Security Updates

- Security updates are released as soon as possible
- Critical vulnerabilities receive immediate patch releases
- All security updates are documented in release notes
- Users are notified of security updates through GitHub releases

## Contact
